transports:
  stdio: true
  http: true
  sse: true
  streamable-http: true

  oauth: false  # Not yet implemented
  custom-headers: true  # Can pass custom headers for auth

installation:
  - "go install github.com/f/mcptools/cmd/mcptools@latest"
notes: |
  - Written in Go (Golang)
  - Uses cobra for CLI framework
  - Automatic transport detection
  - Guard mode currently only works with STDIO transport
  - Known issue: HTTP transport client uses context path with "/sse" prefix
  - Authentication support is on the roadmap
  - Default transport for HTTP/HTTPS URLs is Streamable HTTP
limitations:
  - "Guard mode only works with STDIO, not HTTP transport"
  - "HTTP SSE only supports MCP protocol version 2024-11-05"
