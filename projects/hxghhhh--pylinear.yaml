  evidence: "Source code analysis (2025-12-22) reveals linear.py contains only a Click tutorial example (greeting command) with no actual Linear API integration. setup.py lists only 'click' as dependency - no HTTP/GraphQL client libraries. Repository appears incomplete/placeholder with 5 commits since May 2020."

notes:
  - "Built with Click framework"
  - "Python CLI implementation"
  - "WARNING: Repository appears incomplete - no actual Linear API code found"
