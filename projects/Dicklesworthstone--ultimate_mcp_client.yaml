notes: |
  - Built entirely on Python asyncio
  - Tackles significant engineering challenges around stdio communication
  - Supports potentially noisy or non-compliant stdio servers
  - Network I/O: HTTP, WebSockets, SSE
  - Subprocess communication: stdio
  - Filesystem operations: aiofiles
  - Concurrent background tasks for monitoring
  - Modern streaming-http transport via FastMCP
  - Real-time server discovery on local network
