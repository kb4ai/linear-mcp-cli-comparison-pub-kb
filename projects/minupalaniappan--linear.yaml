  coverage-notes:
    - "Very limited API coverage - focused on git branch workflow"
    - "Only mutation is issueCreate for sub-issues from current branch"
    - "Queries limited to viewer, team, and single issue from branch context"
    - "No issue listing, searching, or updating capabilities"
    - "SDK fields for estimates/due-dates exist but not utilized"
